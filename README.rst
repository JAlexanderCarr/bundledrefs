Bundled References is a project for an independent research study
being conducted by Alexander Carr under Professor Ahmed Hassan
at Lehigh University.  The goal of this independent research study is to take the Bundled References
linked data structure and adapt it to be used in a graph database.  Range queries
across nodes within a graph database are common in graph query workloads, which
creates an opportunity to increase graph database performance with Bundled References.
