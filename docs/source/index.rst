Bundled References Documentation
================================

Bundled References Documentation serves as the wiki and documentation
for an independent research study being conducted by Alexander Carr under Professor
Ahmed Hassan at Lehigh University.  This site holds both information about the
Bundled References code base as well as accompanying background information
that helped advance or contribute to the project.

The goal of this independent research study is to take the Bundled References
linked data structure and adapt it to be used in a graph database.  Range queries
across nodes within a graph database are common in graph query workloads, which
creates an opportunity to increase graph database performance with Bundled References.

   This project is under active development.
